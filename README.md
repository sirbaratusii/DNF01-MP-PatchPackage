# DNF01-MP-PatchPackage
Multiplayer Patch Package for Duke Nukem Forever 2001.
Contains multiplayer fixes from the community + usermaps/addons.

I also give credits to those fixing this game.

NOTE : Please only download the release versions for playing and hosting, as downloading the repo is meant for testing purposes. You can download the usermaps though. It is also advised that you grab the original DNF '01 build and make sure the Megapatch is applied first before using.
